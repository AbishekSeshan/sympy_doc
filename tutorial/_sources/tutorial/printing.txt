 Printing
==========

As we have already seen, SymPy can pretty print its output using Unicode
characters.  This is a short introduction to the most common printing options
available in SymPy.

Printers
========

There are several printers available in SymPy.  The most common ones are

- str
- repr
- ASCII pretty printer
- Unicode pretty printer
- LaTeX
- MathML
- Graphviz

In addition to these, there are also "printers" that can output SymPy objects
to code, such as C, Fortran, Javascript, Theano, and Python.  These are not
discussed in this tutorial.

Setting up Pretty Printing
==========================

If all you want is the best pretty printing, use the ``init_printing``
function.  This will automatically enable the best printer available in your
environment.

    >>> from sympy import init_printing
    >>> init_printing() # doctest: +SKIP

If you plan to work in an interactive calculator-type session, the
``init_session`` function will automatically import everything in SymPy,
create some common Symbols, setup plotting, and run ``init_printing``.

    >>> from sympy import init_session
    >>> init_session() # doctest: +SKIP

    ::

       Python console for SymPy 0.7.2-git (Python 2.7.5-64-bit) (ground types: gmpy)

       These commands were executed:
       >>> from __future__ import division
       >>> from sympy import *
       >>> x, y, z, t = symbols('x y z t')
       >>> k, m, n = symbols('k m n', integer=True)
       >>> f, g, h = symbols('f g h', cls=Function)

       Documentation can be found at http://www.sympy.org

In any case, this is what will happen:

- In the IPython QTConsole, if `\LaTeX` is installed, it will enable a printer
  that uses `\LaTeX`.

  If `\LaTeX` is not installed, but Matplotlib is installed, it will use the
  Matplotlib rendering engine. If Matplotlib is not installed, it uses the
  Unicode pretty printer.

- In the IPython notebook, it will use MathJax to render `\LaTeX`.

- In an IPython console session, or a regular Python session, it will use the
  Unicode pretty printer if the terminal supports Unicode.

- In a terminal that does not support Unicode, the ASCII pretty printer is
  used.
